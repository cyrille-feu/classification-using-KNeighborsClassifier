# classification-using-KNeighborsClassifier
Import the iris dataset from scikit-learn and perform a classification on it using the KNeighborsClassifier (k-NN) for k = 1, 2, . . . , 10. For each value of k record the training and testing errors (using the in-built accuracy score of the k-NN). Then plot both sets of errors on one plot with the right legend.
